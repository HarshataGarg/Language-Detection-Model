## Language Detection Model

This project implements a **Language Detection Model** that automatically identifies the language of a given text input.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze character patterns, word usage, and sentence structure, then predicts the most likely language.

### How It Works
- **Data Processing** – The model is trained on text samples from multiple languages.
- **Feature Extraction** – Converts text into numerical features using Bag-of-Words (BoW) or TF-IDF.
- **Model Training** – Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to distinguish between languages.
- **Prediction** – Processes new text and outputs the predicted language with high accuracy.

### Applications
- Detecting language in user-generated content (social media, reviews, chats)
- Supporting multilingual chatbots and translation tools
- Automatically routing content to language-specific processing pipelines

### Advantages
- Works with multiple languages
- Fast and lightweight for real-time detection
- Easily integrates with translation or text-processing APIs
